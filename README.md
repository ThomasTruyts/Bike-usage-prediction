# Bike Sharing Demand Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. Bike sharing systems provide an automated means of renting bicycles, allowing users to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place as needed. With over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, the data generated by these systems offers valuable insights into mobility patterns within a city.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes historical usage patterns from the Capital Bikeshare program. It captures information such as the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and elapsed time. Additionally, weather data is provided, which can significantly influence bike rental demand.

## Machine Learning Model

The goal of this project is to forecast bike rental demand by combining historical usage patterns with weather data. To improve the model's performance, feature creation techniques were employed. Two different approaches were used: manual feature creation and automatic feature creation.

Manual feature creation involved creating new features based on logic and real-world intuition. The team used their domain knowledge to identify relevant features and engineer them accordingly. On the other hand, automatic feature creation was performed using transformers that act on the data with minimal input from the team. These transformers leverage machine learning algorithms to create new features automatically.

For preprocessing the data, depending on the variable, a simple imputer was used to fill in missing values with the most frequent value. One-hot encoding was applied to handle categorical variables and convert them into a suitable format for the machine learning model.

The machine learning model itself utilized an ensemble method, incorporating both random forest and gradient boosting algorithms. This ensemble approach resulted in an R2 score of 85% and an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 79%, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting bike rental demand.
